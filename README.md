## Gamification

This is the repository for the EESTEC Challenge of 2023 

The main focus of the mobile application was to create an app for smart tourism with gamification. 

Competitive-Geeks developed the design of an application that tracked the user's progress throught a city map, unlocking new levels with interesting factoids and informations about local shops, buildings, attractions etc . 

The design can be seen in figma_link.txt . 

As far as the application is concerned, it was to be build with React-Native and javascript.
